<h1>What is the Food Truck Cashier ?</h1>
<p>Some people always believed to the robots equipped with artifical intelligent will do their jobs instead of them in daylife. Maybe it's so much from today but nowadays we have intelligent builds for assistance us.Lets think about food truck.</p>
<p>In the star wars movie there was intelligent robot which assisting vechiles. Food truck company is more difficult business instead of mortar-brick restaurant business. Because you have to control your costs more carefully. My concept is assisting to the food truck owners as much as possible. Food trucks are small places, because of this lot of people cant work in there at same time. With this program you can get perfect results about cost and stock information, correct menu pricing and maximum efficiency. This mean is less employee for truck and more time for focus your job in truck. If you dont want to see any surprise for your costs and your job you have to keep them under control. </p>
<p>Usually stock programs need push by hand. But in my concept you dont have to enter whole prices or igredients into the programs. You have to keep under control information about purchaces which brought from different places and different prices. R2-D2 can bring you whole information about your food truck in online when you want. İf you need to assistant for 24/7 you should get your R2-D2. Good luck in your business.</p>
